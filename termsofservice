Kyanite Bot - Terms of Service
Last Updated: July 5, 2025

By inviting the Kyanite bot ("Bot", "we", "us") to your Discord server or by using its commands, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Bot and should remove it from your server.

1. Bot Functionality

The Bot provides a wide range of features including, but not limited to, server moderation, an economy system, a leveling system, a ticket system, an invite tracker, music playback, and various utility and fun commands. We reserve the right to add, remove, or modify features at any time without prior notice.

2. User Responsibilities

You agree not to use the Bot for any purpose that is illegal, malicious, or violates Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

You are responsible for the commands you issue to the Bot. Do not use the Bot to spam, harass, or disrupt any server or user.

Abuse of the Bot's features, such as exploiting bugs in the economy system or spamming commands to disrupt service, may result in a temporary or permanent ban from using the Bot.

3. Administrator Responsibilities

If you are a server administrator who has invited the Bot:

You are responsible for the configuration of the Bot on your server, including setting up moderation rules, ticket system categories, and auto-role functions.

You grant the Bot the necessary permissions to function correctly. This may include permissions to read messages, send messages, manage channels, kick members, ban members, and manage roles. The Bot will only use these permissions to execute commands initiated by users or to perform its automated tasks as configured by you.

You agree not to use the Bot's moderation or administrative features to violate the rights of your server members.

4. Data and Privacy

Your use of the Bot is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which details how we collect and use data. By agreeing to these Terms, you also agree to our Privacy Policy.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Bot is provided "as is," without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. While we strive for 100% uptime and accuracy, we do not guarantee that the Bot will be available, uninterrupted, or error-free at all times. Features may be added, changed, or removed at our discretion.

6. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the developers of Core X be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Bot or the use or other dealings in the Bot. This includes, but is not limited to, data loss, server disruption, or actions taken by the Bot based on user commands or configurations.

7. Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will do our best to notify users of any significant changes, but it is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. Your continued use of the Bot after any modifications constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

8. Contact

If you have any questions about these Terms of Service, please contact the bot owner/developer.
