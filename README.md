Terms of Service AND Privacy Policy

KyaniteBot - Privacy Policy
Effective Date: July 5, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Kyanite bot ("Bot", "we", "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you add it to your Discord server or use its features. By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect

To provide its wide range of features, the Bot collects and stores certain data related to servers, channels, and users. All data is stored securely and is necessary for the Bot's functionality.

Server (Guild) Information:

Server ID: To distinguish between different servers and store server-specific settings.

Server-Specific Settings: This includes settings for our advanced features like Auto-Moderation (banned words, filter settings), Leveling (XP settings, role rewards), Ticket System (panel category, staff roles), and Invite Tracker (log channel).

User Information:

User ID: This is the primary identifier we use to track your data across our systems.

Economy Data: Your balance and inventory items are stored per-server to run the economy game.

Leveling Data: Your XP, level, and message count are stored per-server to operate the leveling system.

Moderation Data: If a moderation action (warn, mute, kick, ban) is taken against you, we store a record of this action, including your User ID, the moderator's User ID, the reason, and the timestamp. This is for server moderation and case history purposes.

Invite Data: To track who invited new members, we store a link between the inviter's User ID and the invitee's User ID.

Message Content:

The Bot does not permanently store the content of user messages for logging or analysis, with the following exceptions:

The Auto-Moderation system may temporarily process message content to check for banned words or invite links. If a violation is found, the message content may be logged to a server's private moderation channel for review by moderators.

2. How We Use Information

The data collected is used exclusively to provide and improve the Bot's functionality:

To enable the core features like economy, leveling, games, and moderation.

To save server-specific configurations so the bot works as you set it up.

To create leaderboards and track user progress.

To allow moderators to view a user's moderation history.

To properly attribute invites and manage the invite tracking system.

3. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties

4. Data Storage and Security

All data is stored in secure, separate database files (.db) on the server where the Bot is hosted. We take reasonable measures to protect the information we store, but no security system is impenetrable.

5. Your Rights and Data Deletion

You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data associated with the Bot.

A server administrator can remove the Bot from their server at any time. When the Bot leaves a server, all data associated with that specific server (user balances, levels, settings, etc.) can be manually deleted by the bot owner upon request.

To request data deletion, please contact the bot owner.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

7. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the bot owner/developer.
